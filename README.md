# Project: Associations

We build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like ‚ÄúAndy‚Äôs House‚Äù).

## Built With
- Ruby on rails
